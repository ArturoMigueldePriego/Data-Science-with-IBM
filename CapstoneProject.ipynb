The objective of this project is to determine similarities between Peruvian districts of both the same province and between districts of different provinces. For this, the FourSquare venues data will be used as an indicator of commercial similarity to obtain clusters of different degrees of grouping, and compare the results with classifications made by national organizations such as INEI.\n",
